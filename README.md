# MultilayerPerceptronMnistDataset

In this notebook, I will train an MLP to classify images from the MNIST database hand-written digit database.

The process will be broken down into the following steps:

Load and visualize the data
Define a neural network
Train the model
Evaluate the performance of our trained model on a test dataset!
